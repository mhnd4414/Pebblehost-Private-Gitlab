		{"name": "1.7", "description": "When you create a game, I will now automatically uncover the first region for you."},
		{"name": "1.6", "description": "Added `!minesweeperraw`/`!msraw`. It's the same as the normal minesweeper commands, but it gives you the raw text/copypasta of the game, so you can share it with others. There's also a new `!setprefix` command to change the `!` prefix to something else. Furthermore, the response speed and uptime of the bot have been vastly improved."},
		{"name": "1.5", "description": "`gameWidth` and `gameHeight` are now optional."},
		{"name": "1.3", "description": "Removed unkown command message and added `!ping` command."},
		{"name": "1.2", "description": "Improved error messages and added `!news` command."},
		{"name": "1.1", "description": "Fixed issue where I sometimes didn't reply when you requested large games."},
